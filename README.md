# Accessible Blog
This app was originally created as a service learning project during CSCI 2356 - Mobile App Development (2022) at [Saint Mary's University](https://smu.ca/) in partnership with [Northwood](https://northwood.care/). The blog app was created for a patient in the care facility who required certain accessibility features.

* Implement an accessible on-screen keyboard.
* Implement a word bank to save commonly used words and phrases.
* Implement confirmation dialogs which are shown when saving changes, discarding changes, or deleting a blog.
* Implement the ability to publish a blog, where it will be visible from a public site.
